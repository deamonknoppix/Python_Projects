#Python to build a datawarehouse / Final Consolidated Excel

We have 3 datasets from different colleges/universities

We want to consolidate them into one excel file using Python.

We need to identify the data where it comes from: for example, student who came from trebas should be 
always identified as trebas student in our records inside the datawarehouse.
